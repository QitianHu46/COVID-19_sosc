## Main Questions

* how does form of government affect effectiveness controling the pandemic 

* how is the pandemic affecting countries with different political systems differently 
  * or Culture 
* how similar policy to tackle COVID is having different effects in democratic and authoritarian countries 

### OLS with controls 

* not causal, but can serve as baseline of some sort 

### Diff-in-diff 

* the framework doesn't seem to fit: Diff-in-diff measures effect of an occurance of a treatment in time, but the effect of polity/culture is continuous, and the virus is the 'treatment'.
* +need a more systematic exploration

### Synthetic control 

* consider virus as an event affecting different countries differently 
* may not be a canonical case where this method can be used 

### survival analysis 

* trace happening of a particular event in time 
* maybe use this analysis as a measure of the dependent variable? but there are probably more effective, model-based measures

### natural experiment
